Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period.[17] Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, reverse transcriptase, that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, integrase, and host co-factors.[18] Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system, for an indeterminate amount of time.[19] The virus can remain dormant in the human body for up to ten years after primary infection; during this period the virus does not cause symptoms.

Over time, they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),[1][2] a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive.[3] Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[4]\n\nIn most cases, HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, and vaginal fluids.[5][6] Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid, and through breast milk.[7][8][9][10] Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells. Research has shown (for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples) that HIV is not contagious during sexual intercourse without a condom if the HIV-positive partner has a consistently undetectable viral load.[5][6]\n\nHIV infects vital cells in the human immune system, such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells.[11] HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells,[12] apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells,[13] direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells.[14] When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections, leading to the development of AIDS.\n\nVirology\nComparison of HIV species\nSpecies\tVirulence\tInfectivity\tPrevalence\tInferred origin\nHIV-1\tHigh\tHigh\tGlobal\tCommon chimpanzee\nHIV-2\tLower\tLow\tWest Africa\tSooty mangabey\nClassification\nSee also: Subtypes of HIV\nHIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus,[15] part of the family Retroviridae.[16] Lentiviruses have many morphologies and biological properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period.[17] Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, reverse transcriptase, that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, integrase, and host co-factors.[18] Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system, for an indeterminate amount of time.[19] The virus can remain dormant in the human body for up to ten years after primary infection; during this period the virus does not cause symptoms. Alternatively, the integrated viral DNA may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins, using host cell resources, that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that will begin the replication cycle anew.\n\nTwo types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was initially discovered and termed both lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) and human T-lymphotropic virus 3 (HTLV-III).

It also examines the challenges faced and the strategies implemented to overcome them.\\n\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nThe African Cup of Nations, often abbreviated as AfCON, is a prestigious biennial championship organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Since its inception in 1957, the tournament has served as a platform for African nations to showcase their football prowess and cultural diversity. As the oldest continental football competition, AfCON has played a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of African football and continues to be a beacon of unity and pride for the continent.\\n\\nHistorical Context:\\n\\nThe inaugural AfCON tournament hosted in Sudan in 1957 saw the participation of only three countries: Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia, with Egypt emerging as the first champion. Over the years, the tournament has grown in scope and scale, currently accommodating 24 teams. The expansion reflects the growing interest in football across the continent and the desire to include more nations in this grand event.\\n\\nInfluence on African Football:\\n\\nAfCON has significantly influenced the growth of football in Africa. It has provided a platform for African players to showcase their skills, contributing to the recognition of African talent in global football. Several players who have excelled in AfCON tournaments, such as Didier Drogba, Samuel Eto\\'o, and George Weah, have gone on to have successful careers in European clubs. Furthermore, AfCON has played a crucial role in improving the standard of football infrastructure in many African countries.\\n\\nSocio-economic Impact:\\n\\nHosting the AfCON tournament often yields substantial socio-economic benefits for the host nation. It typically stimulates tourism, promotes local businesses, and creates employment opportunities. Additionally, it serves as an incentive for the host country to upgrade its infrastructure, thereby leaving a long-term positive impact. However, these benefits must be balanced against the substantial costs involved in hosting such a large-scale event.\\n\\nChallenges and Strategies:\\n\\nDespite its numerous benefits, the AfCON tournament also poses several challenges. These include infrastructural constraints, financial difficulties, and sometimes political instability. To tackle these challenges, there is a need for strategic planning and collaboration between the CAF, participating nations, and other stakeholders. Effective strategies may include securing funding from corporate sponsors, improving management and governance structures, and leveraging international partnerships.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nThe African Cup of Nations is more than just a football tournament; it is a celebration of African unity, diversity, and sporting excellence.
